# DiagramControl for WinForms - Change a Shape's Connection Points at Runtime

This example modifies a shape's [ConnectionPoints](https://docs.devexpress.com/WindowsForms/DevExpress.XtraDiagram.DiagramItem.ConnectionPoints) collection at runtime. To illustrate this behavior, we added a trackbar that changes the number and position of connection points.

The `ConnectionPoints` collection does not have public members that allow you to add or remove items. To accomplish this task, create a new point collection and assign it to the [ConnectionPoints](https://docs.devexpress.com/WindowsForms/DevExpress.XtraDiagram.DiagramItem.ConnectionPoints) property:

```cs
PointFloat[] points = new PointFloat[...];
shape.ConnectionPoints = new DevExpress.Diagram.Core.DiagramPointCollection(points);
```
