# DiagramControl for WinForms - How to change a shape's connection points at runtime

This example shows how to use the [ConnectionPoints](https://docs.devexpress.com/WindowsForms/DevExpress.XtraDiagram.DiagramItem.ConnectionPoints) property to change the number of a shape's connection points at runtime.

The `ConnectionPoints` collection does not have public members that allow adding or removing items from it. You need to re-initialize it instead:
```cs
PointFloat[] points = new PointFloat[...];
shape.ConnectionPoints = new DevExpress.Diagram.Core.DiagramPointCollection(points);
```
